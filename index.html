                    As the stars light up the sky tonight, you're the one who makes them pale in comparison. 
                    Your love doesn't just brighten my world, it transforms everything into something magical.

                <p class="text">
                    Every thought I have leads back to you. You are the dream I never want to wake up from, the reason my heart beats stronger each day. 
                    Your kindness, your beauty, and your love are more than I could have ever wished for.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Always and forever, you are my everything.
