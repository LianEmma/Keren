                     As the stars twinkle above us tonight, I can't help but think
                     how lucky I am to know someone like you. Your presence brings
                     a kind of brightness that makes everything feel a little more special.  
                    </p> <br>

                     <p class="text"> 
                         I find myself often thinking about you, and every time I do,
                         it puts a smile on my face. There's something about your kindness
                         and warmth that I truly appreciate, 
                         and I'm excited to see where this journey takes us. 
                    </p> <br>
                    
                    <p class="text">  
                        For now, just know that you mean a lot to me.
                    </p>
